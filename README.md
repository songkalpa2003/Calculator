# Calculator
This is a calculator that has a graphical user interfcae (GUI) and was developed by myself through the use of JavaScript, HTML/CSS. It is a simple calculator that has the basic arithmetic operations (such as adding, subtracting, multiplication, division). I even added buttons to clear everything and to backspace as well as add brackets.
